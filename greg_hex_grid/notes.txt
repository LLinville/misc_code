Divide into layers
given a list of layers of size increasing or decreasing by constant
len(L0) == 1
len(Ln) == len(Ln-1) + 6

Move Ln -> L(n +- 1)

place everything from list A into list B
if you have3 left overs, place them in list C


Given a list of lists of positions. Primary axis is main priority
Move items from L0 -> L1
Move items from L1 -> L2
Priority goes to lowest n
For La -> Lb

Case len(La) < len(Lb)
    Lb[0:len(La)] = La
    Lnext[0:len(evicted from Lb)] = evicted from Lb
