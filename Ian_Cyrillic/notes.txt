old churck and greek comparison
greek stems are target, and if they follow expected pattern
inflectional languages, both
inflectional language has suffixes affixed to nouns that tell you the declention of that noun
all nouns have patterns depending on part of speech
suffix in greek that tells class of noun is -on
Ἄβꙇβ-ος
авив-ъ
avivos - aviva class of nouns
most straightforward pattern:
	cutting off greek suffix and name or stem ends in consonant and masculine, put in class
	with bakier-ъ
	names with vowels end up overlapping marginal inflection classes
		- hebrew name ending in A
			- Masculine nouns of a declention class end in a
Only 9 nouns of that declention class
	222 feminine nouns
	mans name got adapted to be flectional 8 class, despite it being very marginal inflection class

header
-el equiv
	- greek word for greek
	- begins with el

-la latin
	- easy to read

word class has varying details
mem-
	- unknown, but attestations in historical documents
	dictionary ranges from 800s to 1400s

definitions listed are helpful
	- addendum but easily referencable separately

wants context - translations
 old sweedish without modern translations
 looked into appendix of dissertation in his research he found english translations
 -reading them and was surprised they meant something he wouldn't have guessed. (one syllable word meaning punishment)
having definitions and context is appealing because he wants to understand and feel he knows what the data is
sees name in manuscript. who are they?

Wants to see how the sounds of greek words influenced noun classes of equivalent word
highly inflected languages are interesting because
people use networking models to see how they are connected
	- evidence of brains interpreting social systems as analogy of words that sound similar end up behaving similarly in inflected language
	word in one language became a different class over time in a different language
	coming across words causes assumptions and new interpretations
inflection through coming across rhyme
	- same past sentance
		rhymed as association words
	generalization made (climb - climbed)
		- pattern shared
		historically laughed at (clomb)
			- strong verbs of inflection class
	patterns taking ed ending making them strong words
	just in verbs
nouns have 3 genders and inflect in 6-7 cases
	- paradigm of interrelated words
		- patterns (syncrotism eg)
			cases genders overlap in sound
			class 1
				-nomnative os
				accusative on
				genetive oy
				dative oy
				dative genetive are syncronism
			class 2
				-n nomnative
				-s accusative
				-u genetive
				-om dative
			similarities between classes and differences
			words in class 1/2 sound intrasimilar
			classes have different member count
morphophenology of proper names
	looks at phonology interacts with composition of words
	putting words together or their components
	adjacent sounds interact and predict next sounds
	sweedish has some words with two types of accents that have different melodies
		- accent 2 word like "field" olker
		- mirror speille
		OLker
		spayELL
		pitch accents of sweedish are stereotypigenic
		compound words "field mirror"
			- pitch accent it ends up with
				- understanding how it got that pitch accent (accent 1 or 2?)
chop off endings and see comparison
all masculine names ending in consonant end in first class?
if it ends in a vowel, what's the class
phonological stem informs class the ocs noun is adapted to

individuals interact and make metablackboxes

each in column, one word per row

3109
	- two listing
	greek name dionysus
	ocslk who speek greek chop off -us and ending in dionysy
		- class that ends in -y
		other masculine class as first "дионисъ", vs "дионисии"
			- variations in which form and noun class. How that is evaluated by speakers is of interest


egyptioan consonants are more understood than vowels
wants to teach students how historical linguistics came about
appreciate how liguistics don't know and it's the best guesses

historical linguestics 1800s new after 1700s
after 1900s people interested in documeting modern languages scientifically or describing thier components
1950s modern psycological perspective. How do they know when they know a language and what they know


punic to alphabeters:
	- alice in wonderland without vowels
	]	-able to read
top down expectation based on what you already know about language
	- some think bottom up before fluent speaker that is top down



desired output:


header all
"HeaderAll": [
        "дионисъ",
        "дионисии"
      ],

"GramEnd": [
        "иꙗ",
        "а"
      ],
LaEquiv vs LaTrl easiest to read as main key

mem manuscript to look up future links
dictionary forms are also going to be a lingusts or pholologist determines to be base form
not every form will show up in corpus
    - attested in accusative and dative but never nomnative but you know the form it actually is attested in

mem list of abreviations of latin manuscripts
    - the
    supr Suprasliensis as physical manuscript
    - old sweedish tradidtions have similar naming conventions between similar

words containing character in particular
File ID with each row: another for reference is perceived before header all

in list ****ZIPPED****:
    - gram end and header

use first column for word and duplicate rows under word for different correlated values
which manuscripts correspond to which forms

3-4 letters and capitalized are manuscripts "Christ Ochr Slepč Šiš Chrabr Bes Dijav" (cap) under mem



ONLY PROPR. NOUNS
